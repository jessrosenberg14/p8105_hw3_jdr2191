```{r load libraries and dataset}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

```{r}
instacart %>%
  sample_n(500) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = order_hour_of_day, y = order_dow)) + geom_point()
```

There are `r count(instacart)` observations and `r ncol(instacart)` variables in the instacart dataset. Each row in the dataset represents an item ordered by a particular customer.

### How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

```{r aisles}
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>%
  summarize(item_sum = sum(product_id)) %>%
  arrange(desc(item_sum))
```
There are 124 aisles. The top four aisles for the most items ordered from are fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, packaged vegetables fruits, and yogurt.
