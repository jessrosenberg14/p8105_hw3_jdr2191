# Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart %>%
  sample_n(500) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = order_hour_of_day, y = order_dow)) + geom_point()
```

There are 1384617 observations and 15 variables in the instacart
dataset. Each row in the dataset represents an item ordered by a
particular customer.

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
aisles = 
  instacart %>% 
    group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>% 
    summarize(sum_products_ordered = n()) %>% 
    arrange(desc(sum_products_ordered))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle_id'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
view(aisles)
```

There are 134 aisles. The top four aisles for the most items ordered
from are fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables fruits,
yogurt.

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
aislesplot = 
    instacart %>%
    group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>%
    summarize(sum_products_ordered = n()) %>%
    filter(sum_products_ordered > 10000)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'aisle_id'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

``` r
aislesplot %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(aisle, -sum_products_ordered), y = sum_products_ordered)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#6699ff") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,hjust = 1,vjust = 0.5)) +
  ggtitle("The sum of items ordered in each aisle among aisles with more than 10,000 items ordered") +
  xlab("Aisle Name") + ylab("Total number of products ordered")
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
topthree =
  instacart %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>%
  count(product_name, name = "number_ordered") %>%
  arrange(desc(number_ordered),.by_group = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 3) %>%
  subset(select = -c(aisle_id))

knitr::kable(topthree)
```

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
appleicecream =
  instacart %>%
  mutate(order_dow2 = order_dow + 1) %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(order_dow2, label = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  subset(select = c(day_of_week, order_hour_of_day, product_name)) %>%
  group_by(day_of_week, product_name) %>%
  mutate(meanhour = round(mean(order_hour_of_day)), 0) %>%
  subset(select = -c(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  arrange(day_of_week) %>%
  pivot_wider(product_name,
              names_from = "day_of_week",
              values_from = "meanhour"

# Problem 2

Data Cleaning Steps: \* Format the data to use appropriate variable
names; \* Focus on the “Overall Health” topic \* Include only responses
from “Excellent” to “Poor” \* Organize responses as a factor taking
levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")

brfss_tidy = brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic %in% "Overall Health") %>%
  filter(response %in% c("Poor","Fair","Good","Very good","Excellent")) %>%
  mutate(response_factor = factor(response, ordered = TRUE, 
                           levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))

view(brfss_tidy)
```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

``` r
brfss_2002locations = brfss_tidy %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  subset(select = c(year,locationabbr, locationdesc)) %>%
  unique() %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(locationdesc = n()) %>%
  filter(locationdesc >= 7)

view(brfss_2002locations)

brfss_2010locations = brfss_tidy %>%
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  subset(select = c(year,locationabbr, locationdesc)) %>%
  unique() %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(locationdesc = n()) %>%
  filter(locationdesc >= 7)

view(brfss_2010locations)
```

In 2002, 6 states were observed at 7 or more locations. They are CT, FL,
MA, NC, NJ, PA.

In 2010, 14 states were observed at 7 or more locations. They are CA,
CO, FL, MA, MD, NC, NE, NJ, NY, OH, PA, SC, TX, WA.

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state.

``` r
brfssexcellent_df = brfss_tidy %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  subset(select = c(year, locationabbr, locationdesc, data_value)) %>%
  unique() %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  subset(select = c(year, locationabbr, data_value)) %>%
  group_by(locationabbr, year) %>%
  mutate(meandatavalue = mean(data_value)) 

brfssexcellent_df2 = brfssexcellent_df %>%
  subset(select = c(year, locationabbr,meandatavalue)) %>%
  unique()

view(brfssexcellent_df2)

brfssexcellent_df2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = meandatavalue)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) +
  geom_point(aes(group = locationabbr, color = locationabbr), size = .4) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Mean data value", col = "State")
```

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss20062010_df = brfss_tidy %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2006, 2010)) %>%
  filter(locationabbr == "NY")

brfss20062010_df %>%
  mutate(year2 = factor(year, levels = c("2006", "2010"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = data_value, fill = response_factor)) + 
  geom_density(aes(fill = response), alpha = .5) + 
  facet_grid(rows = vars(year2), switch = "y") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "Data Value", fill = "Response") 
```
